# Python Learning Journal
A repo to document my Python learning journey!

## **About Me**
My name is Thomas Galland, I am learning to code so I can apply it to a future job opprotunity! I've had an interest for coding as long as I can remember starting way back in high school, while being pretty computer literate beforehand.

My first true experience with coding is with my internship at CSUMB (California State University of Monterey Bay) when I was touring for colleges, I ran into the head of computer science, Dr. Eric Tao. I expressed my interest and he told me to research Python and he'd give me something to do. I managed to do it, and I was thrown in as a teacher's assistant for a pilot program called Camp Code where we taught children the basics of Python. It was a very fun time.

As time progressed I had some more exposure to different things, like I learned what Linux was back in late middle school to early high school, and really got into it in college where I dedicated a semester in using a Linux system. I taught myself the Bash Scripting language so I can automate certain things to make using my laptop easier.

I also learned coding for modding purposes in some of the games and applications I used. Mainly JavaScript and little bits of Python and C++. In fact I actually realize while making this document that GitHub uses the [same markdown system as Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline) albeit, pretty limited.

## **Goals for This Course**
My overall goal for this course is to rehash my Python knowledge as I work with it every so often, but could use a refresh on how it's done. I would love to learn things I might have overlooked when I was learning it myself.

## **My First Python Program**
```py
code=["Hello, ", "World!"]
print(' '.join(code))

# Yes I did it this way because it was funny.
```
