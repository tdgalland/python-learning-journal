# What happened for Week 1

## Monday
I unfortunately was not attending the class at this day, I was still getting all I needed to be able to get into the course. I super appreciate the professor for allowing me to join in later in the week.

## Wednesday
We went over how programming should be done with how code should be formatted like what is seen below:
```py
#Function: This takes a number and squares it
#Input: An integer that should be squared
#Output: A (hopefully correct I haven't tested) squared number
def example(item)
  new=item**2
  return new

print(example(3))
```

We also learned that we can use AI as a tool to help guide us to how we can use our code, and were dropped in straight away to how to make our code better. Since anyone could use AI to code, but it takes skill to be able to add onto it.


## Summary
This is the first week of class, there isn't much happening besides the foundations so far. There will probably be the same amount of info for Week 2 because of the holiday, but we are having our first lab next week.
